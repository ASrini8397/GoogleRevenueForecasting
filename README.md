# GoogleRevenueForecasting
Here is the Jupyter Notebook file used to forecast Quarterly Revenue data and OpEx for Google utilizing the FbProphet time-series forecasting library in Python. Additionally the raw excel file contains the 3-Statement model, the DCF model, and the interactive dashboard as well. I'm currently
working on adding a tableau file to provide visual insights on the data in another way besides the excel dashboard already included.

This is the current interactive dashboard which allows users to change any of the input parameters for the included graphs to gain deeper insights about the financial performance of the company and to forecast future performance
