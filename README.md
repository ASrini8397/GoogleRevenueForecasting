# GoogleRevenueForecasting
Here is the Jupyter Notebook file used to forecast Quarterly Revenue data and OpEx for Google utilizing the FbProphet time-series forecasting 
library in Python. Additionally the raw excel file contains the 3-Statement model, the DCF model, and the interactive dashboard as well. I'm currently
working on adding a tableau file to provide visual insights on the data in another way besides the excel dashboard already included.
